    "question": "What is the purpose of an interest rate?",
    "options": [
      { "a": "To determine the principal amount of a loan" },
      {
        "b": "To compensate the borrower for lending money"
      },
      { "c": "To calculate the annual percentage yield" },
      { "d": "To estimate the inflation rate" }
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explain": "The interest rate is the amount charged by a lender to a borrower for the use of assets. It acts as compensation for the borrower, as they are essentially lending their money to the borrower and could have earned returns if they had used it elsewhere."

      },

      },
      { "d": "Compound interest" }

    "question": "What is the impact of increasing interest rates on borrowing?",
    "options": [
      { "a": "Borrowing becomes more affordable" },
      {
        "b": "Borrowing becomes more expensive"
      },
      { "c": "Borrowing remains unaffected" },
      { "d": " Borrowing becomes riskier" }
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explain": "When interest rates increase, the cost of borrowing rises. This makes borrowing more expensive for individuals and businesses, as they need to pay higher interest charges on their loans."

  {
    "question": "How do bond prices react to changes in interest rates?",
    "options": [
      {
        "a": "Bond prices and interest rates move in the same direction"
      },
      {
        "b": "Bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions"
      },
      {
        "c": "Bond prices remain unaffected by changes in interest rates"
      },
      {
        "d": "Bond prices react randomly to changes in interest rates"
      }
    ],
    "answer": "b",
    "explain": "Bond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship. When interest rates rise, newly issued bonds offer higher coupon payments, reducing the attractiveness of existing bonds with lower coupon rates. This leads to a decrease in bond prices. Conversely, when interest rates fall, newly issued bonds offer lower coupon payments, increasing the demand for existing bonds with higher coupon rates, resulting in higher bond prices."
